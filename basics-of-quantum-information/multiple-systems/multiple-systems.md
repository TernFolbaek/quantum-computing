# Information in multiple systems

## Classical Information

#### As in the section for single systems, we will begin with our understanding of multiple systems within classical information, thereafter expanding onto the quantum realm.

We can describe the classical states of systems via the Cartesian product. We will begin by formalizing the notation with two systems, for simplicities sake, thereafter with n-amount of systems. Let us discuss this notation with system X and system Y, where system X has a classical state set \(\Sigma \), and system Y with a classical state set \(\Gamma \).
